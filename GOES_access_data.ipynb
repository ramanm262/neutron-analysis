def read_EPS_data(file_name='GOES_SEP_raw.txt'):
    '''
    This function reads the raw data file for the SEP events recorded by GOES and stores relevant information to a
    separate file, in a much more easily readable format. This file must be in the same directory as this script.
    The data can be found at:
    https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/satellite/goes/doc/SPE.txt
    This file is difficult to parse since it does not have a single standard format. As such, there are many if-
    statements in this function that are not necessary on better-formatted data. Even with these checks, the
    formatting of the input file is so inconsistent that some information is still not read properly. The output
    file of this function will therefore contain only 225 events, whereas the input file contains about 266 events.
    Arguments
    file_name: The name of the .txt file containing the data from GOES. 'GOES_SEP_raw.txt' by default.
    output_file_name: The name of the .txt file to which this function will write its output dataframe.
    'GOES_SEP_flares.txt' by default.
    Returns
    Does not return anything. Instead, writes to a file in the same directory as this script.
